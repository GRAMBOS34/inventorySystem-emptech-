# QR Code Inventory System

Made for EMPTECH because the qrcode api of google is deprecated and I couldn't think of a better solution

# Installation

1. Make sure you have Python and pip installed

   Links:

   Python - https://www.python.org/downloads/

   pip (tutorial) - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJKdIf11GcI&ab_channel=TheCodeCity

2) Make sure you launch the terminal (command prompt) in the project folder

   ```
   cd (your project folder)
   ```

3) Run this command in the terminal

   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4) Run this to run the server

   ```
   python main.py
   ```

5) Run this if you'd like to add either books or users
   ```
   python qrCodeGenerate.py
   ```

# Notes

1. Don't delete any of the images in the qrcodes folder when you install it

2. This'll only work if all devices are on the same network

3. Set your network to private (Go to settings > Network & Internet > Properties (of your network) > Network Profile)
